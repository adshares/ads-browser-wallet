### License

This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

### Disclaimer:

Please note that ADS Wallet is still under active development, which is why we strongly encourage you to execute the
first application launch in our Testnet environment. We have thoroughly tested the extension, however there is always a
remote possibility that something unexpected happens that causes your ADS to be lost. Please do not store more ADS than
you are willing to lose, and please be careful.

Please keep in mind that in case you do not save your seed phrase, there is no way to recover access to your wallet or
the funds it holds. Back it up in multiple physical locations – not just on your computer!
